# RedditClient

RedditClient is an app I built using React and Redux for global state management.  This app is meant to be a minimalist version of reddit.  

The app allows users to view recent Reddit posts from a defined list of popular subreddits.  The users can also search the post titles.  

In this project I focused on using GitHub for project management.  I created a project board, used issues to track features and bugs, and created pull requests to address issues.  I learned Github is a powerful project management tool and look forward to using it more.
